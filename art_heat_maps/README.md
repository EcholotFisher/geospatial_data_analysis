Duration of the workshop - 1 Day

## Talk summary
Let's take an overview of some common daily data processing on geospatial data and
use it as a gift idea. An alcoholic drink place recommender inside a city.

Some briefly touched techniques:

- What is geospatial data
- Geopandas
- Geometry operations - buffer and intersection
- Open Street Maps and street networks with OSMNx

## Execution Requirements
- make sure you have `make` build system  
  - Linux and Mac should have it by default  
  - Windows - Check [installer](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm). Windows users usually have some more difficulties (sorry!). In any case, check dockerfile for installed python packages and extra utilitaries.  
- make sure you have `docker` with **minimum 4Gb allocated to containers**. Check [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container) for an example.

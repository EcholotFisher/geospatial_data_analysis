# Feature Engineering for Spatial Data Analysis in the Context of Fare Prediction

Link: [https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/feature-engineering-for-spatial-data-analysis](https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/feature-engineering-for-spatial-data-analysis)

Duration of the workshop - 1 Day

## Workshop summary
In this workshop, participants will be able to understand what are the types of data processing they can do in order to extract better knowledge out of their spatial data. We will introduce tools for visualizing, extracting features and feature engineering and explain the logic and steps needed in order to create them. The techniques will be presented in the context of a simple machine learning model for predicting taxi tariffs and illustrate how we can improve it with these new features.

Participants will be able to learn:

- Visualise spatial data for exploratory data analysis
- Understand and calculate distances
- Extract routes, route distances and estimated durations
- Extract city features based on open source tools, e.g. Open Street Maps
- Data processing performance - Spatial indices in Python
- Ideas for traffic estimation
- Approaches and potentials for GPS analysis and how they can help you in terms of feature engineering.

## Execution Requirements
- make sure you have `make` build system
  - Linux and Mac should have it by default
  - Windows - Check [installer](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- make sure you have `docker`
---

### Setup
1. (starting script) in your terminal, from the AMLD project folder, run: `make setup`
2. after it's done, run `make up` -
3. at the end of the process, you'll see a link similar (not equal) to the one below

`http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=8a9ce1b6213dc455003b2ccdc79028a00b660b7666f9841b`  

4. copy and paste the link into your browser
5. to uninstall everything, run `make clean`
